# NFT marketplace in 10 days challenge

In this project I am giving myself a challenge where I can build an NFT marketplace in 10 days.
Each day progress will be updated in day to day basis and learning will be shared

We will be using React Js , Node js and Hardhat to build the project


The project will have these basic features

1) Connect metamask wallet.
2) Create NFT and upload for sale set the bid amount.
3) List all NFT's for sale.
4) Purchase NFT that is listed
